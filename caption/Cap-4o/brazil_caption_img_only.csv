One person in line asks another why they are there if they aren't sick. The response is humorous, suggesting that by the time they receive care, they might actually become ill. This cartoon satirizes the long wait times associated with the health system."
81,"The image consists of three abdominal X-rays of a newborn, taken at intervals of 1 hour, 12 hours, and 24 hours. The X-rays show the progression of air distribution in the intestines, possibly indicating changes in gastrointestinal function over the first day of life. Each X-ray captures the thoracic and abdominal regions, highlighting the ribs and the presence of air-filled spaces in the abdomen."
82,"The image is an electrocardiogram (ECG) tracing showing a pattern consistent with ventricular tachycardia. The ECG displays rapid, regular, and wide-complex QRS waves, indicating a fast heart rhythm originating from the ventricles. Each lead (I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, V1-V6) shows consistently wide and uniform patterns typical of this arrhythmia."
83,"This image shows a pair of X-rays of a pediatric chest and abdomen. The X-ray on the left is an anterior-posterior (AP) view, while the one on the right is a lateral view. The images display the bony structures like ribs and spine, as well as gas-filled structures in the abdomen, which could be loops of the bowel. There may be signs suggestive of bowel obstruction or other gastrointestinal issues given the distribution of gas."
84,"The biomedical image from Brazil includes:

1. **Figura 1 — Palpação obstétrica**: Illustrations showing various techniques of obstetric palpation, which involve hands examining the abdomen of a pregnant woman to assess the position and development of the fetus.

2. **Figura 2 — Gráfico da altura uterina para a semana de gestação**: A graph showing uterine height measurements plotted against weeks of gestation. The graph is used to track the growth of the uterus during pregnancy, with percentiles marked to indicate different growth curves.

Both figures are from a publication by the Brazilian Ministry of Health, intended for prenatal care guidelines and monitoring."
85,"This is an X-ray image of a human chest. The image shows the lungs, heart, and surrounding structures. The lungs appear mostly clear, but there is a notable radiopaque area in the right upper lung field, which could indicate an abnormality such as a fluid collection or mass. The cardiac silhouette appears normal in size and position. The diaphragm and rib structures are also visible."
86,"The image appears to be a radiograph showing the gastrointestinal tract. It most likely includes a fluoroscopic view, as the contrast highlights the esophagus, stomach, and potentially other parts of the digestive system. The black arrows indicate a specific area of interest, which could be suggesting an abnormality, such as narrowing or obstruction, possibly related to a condition like esophageal atresia."
87,"The image is an X-ray of the legs. The bones appear affected by fibrous dysplasia, resulting in deformity and structural irregularities. The characteristic ""ground-glass"" appearance seen in fibrous dysplasia could be present, along with the possible bowing of the long bones."
88,"This chest X-ray image shows the thoracic region with clear visualization of the lungs, heart, and ribs. There is a distinct circular opacity in the upper region of the right lung, which may suggest a lesion or mass. The heart appears slightly enlarged, and the left lung field is more radiolucent than the right. This image may require further analysis to evaluate potential abnormalities."
89,"The image consists of two graphs on grid paper. 

1. The top graph shows a red line representing blood pressure over time, measured in mmHg, ranging from 30 to 210. 
2. The lower graph displays another data set, represented by a black line, which could be related to another physiological parameter.

Both graphs span a time period from 00:24 to 00:27, with a scale of 3 cm per minute, indicating that they might be part of a simultaneous recording of cardiovascular and respiratory parameters."
